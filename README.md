## General Information
- This project serves a as simulation of a real-time banking database system specific to details of loans.
- When applying for a loan a bank needs to consider a lot of things including whom to give a loan and who is able to pay it back.
- The project validates there decisions or shows the errors of their decisions.
	Here the demonstration to advise the bankers about the opportunities that they have grabbed or missed based on the decisions they took in a certain time frame
- Dataset named "Loan.csv" is being used a the source of truth here. 
The data set consists of entries of every payment a customer has made or the bank has made grained to the customer-level and date on which the payment was made.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Analysis points
- checking the data only for the verified sources. 
(i.e. where the verification_status of the record is Source verified or Verified)
- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, 
then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, 
then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

Identifying pattern on which the above two conditions can be identified
basis on which we check if a customer is likely to repay the loan
